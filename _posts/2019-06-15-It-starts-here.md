**Why did I create this blog?**
===
These days, me and one of my close friends found extreme interest in learning Data Science and getting a basic idea of what machine learning is, and the main reason for that is because of the money in the game, our main goal is not money, we want to use the money as a tool to support big projects in the future, projects that can actually be of huge help to other people. One of the first steps that i wanted to take towards my goal is to open up a blog and post on it weekly. Since this is my first week, i'll be getting a basic idea on the world of data science, since I already know how to code on python i'll jump straight in it and see how it goes.
