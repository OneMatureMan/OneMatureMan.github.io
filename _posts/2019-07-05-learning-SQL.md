**What i've been doing for the past week**
===
I couldn't post last week due to being extremely busy, and that's not a good excuse since I had made a commitment that i'll be writing here every single week. Anyway, i'll try my best to keep doing that things that I have to do. So since last time I had posted, i've still been trying to imporve my SQL skills and to just push myself to write more and more queries. I really want to learn other things while learning
SQL but it's hard for me to focus on more than one thing at a time. SQL is easy but it needs time and patience in order to get the hang of it. I believe database systems is one of the essential skills a man needs throughout his journey to learn machine learning, just wanted to say that. see you next week :)
