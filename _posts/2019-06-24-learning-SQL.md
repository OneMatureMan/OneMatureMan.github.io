**What i've been doing for the past week**
===
The weather is getting hot here in Istanbul, but that's not going to stop us at all! For the past week i've been going back and forth,
trying to decide where to start my machine learning journey. I first started with calculus. I watched a couple of videos on youtube to,
get me started, and I was planning to get a calculus book, but then I decided that i should start learning SQL basics and Database basics
first, since it will not only help me in my machine learning journey, but also with a food application project that i'm working on now.
I'll keep updating weekly :)
