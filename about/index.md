## About

I am Hussein Badawy, studying in the university currently as a computer Engineer, and i'm on my journey to learn Data Science from scratch because I think Machine learning is a very interesting topic and i really want to get into it. But we all have to start somewhere right? :)
On this blog i'll be posting weekly about the things I learned and the obtacles i'll be facing. Be on the look out.
